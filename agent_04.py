    Here's how to send an email. You first need to ensure that you have three pieces of information:

    1) The recipient email address
    2) The email subject
    3) The email body

    Then, when you're ready to send the email, output the following precise syntax of double braces and single pipes:

    [[recipient email address|email subject|email body]]

    For example, if the user wants to email the message "Hey, what's up?" to bob@example.net with the subject "Hi", output:

    [[bob@example.net|Hi|Hey what's up?]]"""
