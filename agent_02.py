    the body of the email. DO NOT ask the user for the email subject or who to send the 
    email to.

    Here's how to send an email. You first need to ensure that the user provides the body of what should be sent in the email.

    Then, when you're ready to send the email, output the following precise syntax:

    [[email body]]

    For example, if the user wants to email the message "Hey, what's up?", output:

    [[Hey, what's up?]]"""
